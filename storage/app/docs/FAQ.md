# Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use TreeSnap outside of the United States?

Yes! TreeSnap functions globally. Most of our userbase is located within the United States, but as you can see from our 
[Public Map](https://treesnap.org/map/?center=48.31851827972496,11.322487095768032&zoom=5), we have users from all over 
the world. We are excited to see the app being used in other countries and hope to expand our partnerships and research 
programs to include more international projects.

### Why are tree locations altered?

Some of the trees TreeSnap records are very valuable or are on private land. 
To protect the trees and the privacy of landowners, we do not display exact 
locations on our map. Instead, locations are randomly altered and reported 
within a 5 mile radius.
 
TreeSnap and our partner breeding programs have access to the original reported 
coordinates. Prior to viewing or sampling any tree on private land, we will contact 
the owner of the land for consent.

### I reported a tree at x location, but it appears somewhere else.

We do not publicly display precise locations to protect the trees and individual 
landowner privacy. Only administrators, or the logged in user who reported a 
tree, can see the precise location of a tree. You can also see the exact location 
you reported on your own mobile device.

Rest assured, your data and the original accurate locations are stored and available 
for research groups so that you can help save these tree species!

### Is my data safe?
TreeSnap uses an encrypted connection (TLSv1.3) to secure all communication between 
the server and your mobile device or browser. The exact locations of your trees are 
stored in a secured databases behind a firewall. Only our partner organizations will 
be granted access to the exact location of trees you report in TreeSnap.

### Are there training documents for using TreeSnap?

We are currently creating training material for using the TreeSnap app. 

In addition to these guides, we will be hosting virtual training sessions 
for using TreeSnap. For more info, follow us on Twitter or [contact us](/contact).

### Does TreeSnap help me identify trees?

TreeSnap does not currently act as a tree identification guide. The **Info** 
tab for each tree in the app provides key identification features for each 
species and can serve as a reference. We hope to implement training in the 
future to help users learn to identify different tree species.

### How can I update TreeSnap to the latest version?

By visiting the App Store or Play Store on your device, then searching for 
TreeSnap you can determine whether your version is up to date if there isn't an update button on the app page.

Both iPhone and Android devices have a feature to allow you to automatically
download updates as soon as they become available. Please 
see [this tutorial for Android device](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/113412?hl=en) 
and [this tutorial for iPhones](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202180).
