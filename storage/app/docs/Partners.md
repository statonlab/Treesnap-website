# Partners
TreeSnap depends on our partner research groups and breeding programs that will use the tree data you provide.  These groups have existing programs (or future plans) for this data and will get in touch with you if they decide to follow up on your samples.  They include:

# USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station 
 
 The [UDSA Forest Service Northern Research Station's](https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/nrs) mission is to provide basic and applied knowledge about, and develop methods for, protecting and sustaining landscapes disturbed by invasive species and other agents.
 
As a TreeSnap partner, they will use data on ash and elm to find trees that are resistant to the emerald ash borer and Dutch elm disease.  They plan to use data from areas where these threats have been established for some time to identify “lingering” trees that survive long past others have died to be used in research and breeding programs.

# Forest Restoration Alliance 
The [Forest Restoration Alliance](https://www.facebook.com/ThreatenedForests) works to restore healthy forests and landscapes in eastern America by researching and addressing invasive pest threats to hemlock, firs, and other native trees.  They will use data on hemlock to find trees that are resistant to hemlock woolly adelgid.

# Hemlock Restoration Initiative 
 The [Hemlock Restoration Initiatve](http://savehemlocksnc.org/) aims to restore eastern and Carolina hemlocks to their native habitats throughout North Carolina and to mitigate damage to hemlocks caused by infestation of the hemlock woolly adelgid.  They will use data on hemlock to find trees that are resistant to hemlock woolly adelgid.

# American Chestnut Foundation 

[The American Chestnut Foundation](https://www.acf.org/) seeks to return the American chestnut to its native range.

The American Chestnut Foundation will use data on chestnuts to find trees that are resistant to chestnut blight to be added to breeding and research programs.  In addition to sampling with the TreeSnap app, please submit a physical sample of the tree to the American Chestnut Foundation since other species can easily be confused with American chestnut.   You can find full instructions, as well as addresses to ship samples to, [here](https://www.acf.org/va/contact-us/report-live-tree/).

# Forest Health Research and Education Center
 [The Forest Health Research and Education Center's](http://www.foresthealthcenter.org) mission is to advance the conservation of forested ecosystems by integrating genetics-based biological research with social science research and education and outreach on factors affecting tree health and forest restoration.
 

The Forest Health Research and Education Center will use data on white oak to build a breeding program.  Their goal is to be better prepared in the event that any invasive pests that target white oak are introduced in the future.

# Atlanta Botanical Garden

[Atlanta Botanical Garden’s](http://atlantabg.org/) mission is to develop and maintain plant collections for display, education, research, conservation and enjoyment. The Garden has launched the Center for Southeastern Conservation, an expansion of the Garden’s conservation research and education. Through conservation of imperiled species and habitats in the Carolinas, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, the Center protects the natural heritage of one of North America’s most biodiverse regions.
