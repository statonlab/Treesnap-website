# The Trees of TreeSnap

## American chestnut

American chestnut (_Castanea dentata_) was once a dominant tree in eastern North American forests but a deadly fungal disease wiped out most of these trees in the early 1900s.

### Chestnut blight
 Chestnut blight is caused by the fungus _Cryphonectria parasitica_.  It was introduced to North America in the early 1900s by accidentally importing infected Asian chestnut trees. Most Asian chestnuts are quite resistant to the fungus but American chestnut proved highly susceptible and by 1940 few mature chestnut trees were left.
          The fungus that causes chestnut blight grows in the vascular system of the tree, forming a canker and eventually girdling the tree. Symptoms of chestnut blight include cracked bark, sunken cankers, and fungal structures.
Several breeding programs exist to develop trees that are resistant to chestnut blight. Many of these rely of hybridizing American chestnuts with resistant Chinese of Japanese chestnuts and then back crossing to American chestnut. 
            Our hope is that this reporting app will let members of the public identify chestnut trees that have some natural resistance to chestnut blight.

## Elm

American elm (_Ulmus americana_)is a native species to North America that was once the dominant tree species along city and suburban streets. The American elm were known for their beautiful canopies and tolerance to poor soil conditions. After the introduction of Dutch elm disease in the 1930's, American elms have disappeared from the American cityscape.

### Dutch elm disease

Dutch elm disease is caused by a parasitic fungus (_Ophiostoma ulmi_) and is spread by elm bark beetles.  Fungal infection results in the tree plugging its own xylem tissue in an attempt to stop its spread.  This stops the flow of water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the tree, killing it.

## Ash

There are several different species of American ash trees, all of which are susceptible to the deadly emerald ash borer.
 * White ash _Fraxinus americana_
 * Green ash _Fraxinus pennsylvanica_
 * Black ash _Fraxinus nigra_
 * Blue ash _Fraxinus quadrangulata_


### Emerald ash borer

An invasive insect, the emerald ash borer, is currently moving through North America and killing ash trees. The larvae of this beetle feed on the inner bark of ash trees, cutting off the tree’s flow of water and nutrients and eventually killing the tree. All American ash species are susceptible to the emerald ash borer and so far there is very little natural resistance to the insect in our trees.
Our hope is that this reporting app will let members of the public identify ash trees that are lingering after the emerald ash borer’s arrival and which may have some natural resistance. Partners will then collect seeds from these trees and add them to tree breeding programs to try and propagate resistant trees that are not killed by the emerald ash borer to use in forest restoration.

## White oak

White oak (_Quercus alba_) is an extremely important tree species. It provides wood for lumber (including bourbon barrels) and is also a key food source for wildlife. It is a key component of the central hardwood forests. Mature white oaks typically grow very large, 80-100 feet high, and have broad, full canopies. White oaks can live a very long time and some trees have been found that are over 400 years old.

## Hemlock
American hemlock species are being killed by hemlock woolly adelgids.  Hemlocks are beautiful evergreen trees native to North America.  Many species of wildlife utilize hemlock stands as a habitat, and the trees are also popular ornamentals.

* Eastern hemlock _Tsuga canadensis_
* Carolina hemlock _Tsuga caroliniana_

### Hemlock woolly adelgid

This insect sucks the sap of hemlock trees, weakening trees, preventing new growth, and eventually killing trees. In addition, hemlock woolly adelgids are thought to inject a toxin when feeding that further damages hemlock trees by drying them out. Infested trees loose needles and branches and typically die 4-10 years after initial adelgid arrival unless treated.
The hemlock woolly adelgid’s name comes from the insect’s egg sacs, which hang from the undersides of branches at certain times of year and look like small woolly tufts. These insects are invasive in North America, introduced from Japan.
Our hope is that this reporting app will let members of the public identify hemlock trees that have some natural resistance to hemlock woolly adelgid.

## Florida Torreya

Florida Torreya (_Torreya taxifolia_) is one of the rarest tree species in the US, with distribution limited to a very narrow area of the upper Apalachicola River basin in Florida and just into Georgia. It used to be the dominant mid-story tree in the Apalachicola bluffs and ravines region, but in the 1950s the trees began dying off from a fungal blight and now only a fraction of trees remain. Help us by providing locations and measurements of trees on private property, and especially to find disease-free trees.

Florida Torreya is also known as Gopherwood, Stinking Cedar, and Florida nutmeg.

### Fusarium torreyae

The deadly fungus has been identified as _Fusarium torreyae_, thought to be imported from Asia, and appears to be ubiquitous in the ravines area. Root sprouts die before reaching maturity and producing fruit, so the species will go extinct in the wild without intervention. Researchers will coordinate with you to take cuttings of your trees which will be grown offsite to save the most genetic diversity possible. Of utmost importance is finding trees that do not exhibit cankers or other signs of disease stress so that genes for disease resistance can be found and used in a breeding program.

## Eastern Larch

Eastern larch (Larix laricina) is common in New England, the upper Midwest, and much of Canada. It often goes by the alternative common names of Tamarack and American Larch. Eastern larch is one of the few gymnosperms that experience this Autumn leaf senescence. The process of needle senescence in Eastern larch is not well understood. Researchers are aiming to investigate this by collecting samples throughout the annual cycle of individual trees, to study both their physical and genetic characteristics.

The needle dropping period occurs very soon after the needles change color from green-blue to golden-yellow. The specific timing of this period can vary due to changes in temperatures and daylight patterns. Needle samples will be collected in the Fall for sequencing and it is important to document the color changes and needle drop to further our understanding of this phenomenon.

## Pacific Madrone

The Pacific madrone (*Arbutus menziesii* Pursh) tree is the largest member of the family Ericaceae. It is the most distinctive hardwood tree native to the West Coast of North America, ranging from southwestern British Columbia to southern California. In natural forest ecosystems, the tree is rarely dominant, but it is diagnostic of unique plant communities found on drier, lower elevation sites as well as on coastal bluffs and mountains. The tree is relatively drought tolerant and fast growing, but does not tolerate extreme temperature changes.

## Tanoak

Tanoak is a broadleaf evergreen tree most commonly found in coastal locations in southern Oregon, its range extends east to the Siskiyou and Klamath mountains. Oblong leaves are thick and leathery with a wavy-toothed border, shiny light green above, whitish beneath, 6-13 cm long, 2-6 cm wide.  Flowers are unisexual, male flowers are in catkins 5-10 cm long, white but turning rust colored, with an unpleasant odor; greenish-yellow female flowers are found at the base of catkins.  Acorns are egg-shaped, 2-3 cm long, shallow saucer-shaped cup, covered with dense bristles; mature in the second year.

Tanoak is an important native hardwood species in southern Oregon, with significant ecological and cultural values.  This species is suffering significant mortality from Phytophthora ramorum, the introduced pathogen that causes Sudden Oak Death.

Healthy mature tanoaks identified in this program will be assessed for acorn collection. Acorns will be grown in seedling trials to determine genetic resistance to Sudden Oak Death with the goal of propagating resistant trees to use in forest restoration.

## Butternut

Butternut belongs to the same genus as black walnut and has a compound leaf with 9-17 leaflets per leaf. Bark of a mature tree is platy and ash-gray with dark gray fissures between the platy ridges. On small twigs, lenticels are round (hybrids are elongated); leaf scar is not notched (hybrids may have a notch on the ‘forehead’ of the ‘monkey face’); leaves are glossy (hybrids tend to be hairy); nuts have sharp ridges (hybrids tend to be smoother and have a prominent suture along its center). See Farlee et al 2010 for tips on identifying butternuts, walnuts, and hybrids.

Butternut is disappearing from a pathogen known as Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum (Oc-j). We are interested in the location of survivor trees for future seed collection and grafting.

## Pinyon Pine (Piñon Pine)

Pinyon pine is a short bushy evergreentree with two needles in a sheath or bundle. The needles are a half inch to two inches long. It often grows with juniper in lower elevation mountain foothills environments.

A significant limitation to reforesting the Las Conchas Fire area is the lack of good local seed. It is critical to find and collect tree seeds for the purpose of growing seedlings from them in a forest nursery and then planting them to restore these post-fire landscapes. Pinyon pine cone and seed crops vary by year and by place, with good crops of seeds only available every 3-7 years. This makes it hard to count on collecting seeds in a particular location, so extensive seed scouting is necessary to support collection efforts.
