### The TreeSnap project

Help our nation’s trees! Invasive diseases and pests threaten the health of America’s forests. Scientists are working to understand what allows some individual trees to survive, but they need to find healthy, resilient trees in the forest to study. That’s where concerned foresters, landowners, and citizens (you!) can help. Tag trees you find in your community, on your property, or out in the wild using **TreeSnap**!
  
Scientists will use the data you collect to locate trees for research projects like studying genetic diversity of tree species and building better tree breeding programs. 


### The TreeSnap team

TreeSnap is developed as a collaboration between Scientists at the University of Kentucky and the University of Tennessee.  The project is funded in part by the [NSF Plant Genome Research Program](https://nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5338).
